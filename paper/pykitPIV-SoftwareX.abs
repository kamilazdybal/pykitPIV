We describe \texttt{pykitPIV}, a PyTorch-compatible Python library for generating synthetic images that mimic those obtained from particle image velocimetry (PIV) experiments. The library can be readily ported to training machine learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), or reinforcement learning (RL). Our image generation exploits the kinematic relationship between two PIV snapshots and advects particles from one time frame at $t_1$, to the next at $t_1 + \Delta t$, with a second-order accurate numerical scheme. This results in paired image intensities, $I_1$ and $I_2$ that are separated by $\Delta t$ in time. The goal of this library is to give the user a lot of flexibility in selecting various parameters that would normally be available in an experimental setting such as particle seeding density, thickness of the laser plane, camera exposure, particle loss due to out-of-plane movement, or time separation between images. The richness of image generation can find application in training machine learning algorithms such as CNNs or RL.
